            Are you a complete beginner or are you already brewing in this direction,
            but at the same time want to reach a professional level? Great, and we can give it to you. All work takes
            place
            at the computer. Cinema 4d and After Effects to help walk you through the steps of creating a motion
            commercial.
            <br><br>
            First we will do art direction to work out the idea and style of your video. Then we will do
            previsualization and blocking inb order to roughly
            understand how good our idea is in dynamics.
            After that we will deal with filling, styling and modeling. Then materials, lighting, effects,compositing.
            <br><br>
            At the very end, we will set up a cool render and start the promotion of our video. Our courses are not
            about creating a full fledged work for portfolio. So move
            from a sofa to chair and start preparing. It will be difficult, but very cool.
